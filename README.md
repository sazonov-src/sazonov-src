# Hi, I'm Vitalii ðŸ‘‹

## Full-Stack Product Developer & Cloud Architect

I help businesses transform ideas into scalable, production-ready productsâ€”fast. By leveraging proven tools and cloud-native architecture, I build solutions that deliver immediate business value without unnecessary complexity.

### ðŸš€ What I Bring to the Table
- **Authentication Systems**: Fast, flexible user management with AWS Cognito + role-based access
- **Serverless Architecture**: Cost-efficient AWS Lambda & SAM implementations (pay-per-use model)
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive interfaces with Tailwind CSS + TypeScript/React
- **Payment Systems**: Seamless Stripe integrations and third-party service connections
- **AI-Powered Development**: Accelerated MVP delivery using AI-assisted workflows

### ðŸ§© My Philosophy
Early-stage success demands speed and efficiency. I prioritize battle-tested solutions over custom-built complexityâ€”delivering maximum value with minimal overhead. As I like to say: *"You don't need a custom rocket when a jet gets you there faster."*
